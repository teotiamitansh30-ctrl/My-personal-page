<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
Hello! I'm Mitansh, a first-year student pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at the Manipal Institute of Technology. Hailing from Gurgaon, I've always been fascinated by how technology can be used to solve real-world problems. My journey into CSE is fueled by a deep curiosity for understanding complex systems and a desire to build innovative software. I am particularly drawn to the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and I am eager to develop a strong foundation in these areas during my journey at college.

<h2>My Future Goals</h2>
<p>
My primary academic goal is to dive deep into the world of Computer Science. After completing my B.Tech, I aspire to pursue a Master of Science (MS) from a top-tier university, where I can specialize in fields like Artificial Intelligence. I aim to contribute to meaningful projects that push the boundaries of technology and have a positive impact on society.
</p>
<p>
I am also deeply fascinated by entrepreneurship and the idea of building something of my own. I hope to one day start a venture that leverages technology to solve a real-world problem.
